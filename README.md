# Snippets

Got some smalluns I want to make while waiting on loading screens!

## Eagerly awaiting:
* Todo List
* Timer
* Tiny Drawpad

## Not right now, but eventually:
* Todo that only shows a smaller, accessible step to a larger task.
* Visual Timer, compartmentalizes amounts and shows visual progress instead of just sticks 'n integers.
* Something something HTMX
